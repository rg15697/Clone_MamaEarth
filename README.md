## Challanges

- This time our team was working with the React library and no one was confident in this. I was totally unable to work with the library of React. Then we decided That I (Rohit Kumar Gupta) will work using HTML CSS and JavaScript. And they will convert it into React and finally, we will merge. I cloned the pages like the Authentication page(login, Signup, and otp page), Profile page, MamaCash page, Manage address page, and contacts page with 100% functionality and responsive for mobile view and desktop view. But at the time of conversion, we were unable to convert it and at last, our team decided to create an authentication page separately using React and merge to complete the project.

- We faced challenges with CSS As popup message alignment.
- And at last, we faced the problem to make it responsive to mobile view and finally we have submitted a desktop view clone.
